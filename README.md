# Hello-Twitch

A bot to interact with twitch chat!

create .env file in root directory and add your oauth (one way to get it is from https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)

.env :
```
TWITCH_OAUTH=YOUROAUTHTOKENHERE
```

_This was mostly me testing rust at the beginning, hence the name hello-twitch as I didn't know how it was gonna turn out at first. 
This code is very messy and is all just in one file. I plan to make a new bot so this is now archived and public_
